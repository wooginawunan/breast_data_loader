# breast_data_loader

This is a simplified template of https://github.com/gmum/toolkit/tree/master/pytorch_project_template. 

It focuses on evaluating the data loader's performance.

Example: ``python bin/train.py save_to_folder configs/breast.gin``.


## TODO:

1. Untested.
2. Still importing functions outside this repository. 
3. Currently only logging estimated time and further timer could be implemented.
